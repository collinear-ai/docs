Comprehensive evaluation of agent workflows across multiple dimensions.


### Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description | Scale |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Goal Completion | Does the agent achieve its purpose? | 0-1 |
| Step Efficiency | Optimal path to solution | 1-5 |
| Context Retention | Maintains conversation memory | 1-5 |
| Error Rate | Unsuccessful steps | % |
| User Satisfaction | Predicted user experience | 1-5 |


### Preset Metrics:
- **Action Completion**: Did the agent achieve *all* user goals?
- **Action Advancement**: Did it progress *any* goal?
- **Tool Selection Quality**: Did the agent select the correct tool and parameters?
- **Tool Errors**: Did the tool execution steps succeed?
- **Instruction Adherence**: Did the LLM follow the given instructions?
- **Context Adherence**: Is the response grounded in retrieved/expected context?


### Assessment Process
1. Select generated dataset
2. Choose evaluation metrics
3. Configure assessment parameters
4. Run evaluation
5. Review heatmap visualization

### Interpreting Results
+ **&lt;0.5** : Critical issue needing immediate attention
+ **0.5-0.7** : Significant room for improvement
+ **0.7-0.9** : Good but can be optimized
+ **&gt;0.9** : Excellent performance
