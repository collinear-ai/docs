title: 'Upload Dataset (Assess Pipeline)'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/dataset/upload/platform'
---

## Overview

Use this endpoint when you want rows to skip the regular dataset list and go
straight into the Assess dashboard. It is the first call in the Assess
Conversations workflow.

### Form fields

- `file` *(required)*: JSON file containing an array of rows with
  `conv_prefix` and `response` objects. Use `application/json` for the MIME type.
- `dataset_name` *(required)*: Friendly name that appears in the dashboard.
- `space_id` *(required)*: UUID for the destination space.
- `evaluation_type` *(required)*: Typically `safety`; determines which judge
  templates Collinear recommends.
- `skip_context_check` *(optional)*: Set to `true` to skip automatic field
  validation while prototyping.

### Example request

```bash
curl https://stage.collinear.ai/api/v1/dataset/upload/platform \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -F 'file=@conversations.json;type=application/json' \
  -F 'dataset_name=assess-demo' \
  -F 'space_id=<SPACE_ID>' \
  -F 'evaluation_type=safety' \
  -F 'skip_context_check=true'
```

### Response

On success the API returns a JSON body similar to:

```json
{
  "message": "Dataset uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "dataset_id": "<DATASET_ID>",
    "eligible_evaluation_types": {"evaluation_types": ["safety", "performance"]},
    "rows": 2
  }
}
```

Persist the `dataset_id` for the follow-up judge creation and assess run calls.
