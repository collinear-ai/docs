## Overview

Use this endpoint to evaluate a response in the context of a conversation. The system uses a judge model (specified by `judge_id`) to assess the quality or appropriateness of the given `response` based on the prior `conversation_prefix`.

This is useful for scoring, grading, or analyzing the helpfulness, accuracy, or tone of a response generated by an assistant.
The endpoint is designed to work with a conversation format, where the `conversation_prefix` contains the context of the conversation, and the `response` is the assistant's reply.
