## Overview

Use this endpoint to evaluate a response in the context of a conversation. The system uses a judge model (specified by `judge_id`) to assess the quality or appropriateness of the given `response` based on the prior `conversation_prefix`.

This is useful for scoring, grading, or analyzing the helpfulness, accuracy, or tone of a response generated by an assistant.

The endpoint is designed to work with a conversation format where the
`conversation_prefix` contains prior turns and `response` is the assistantâ€™s
reply. On staging the returned payload includes:

- `score`: numeric grade (higher means more concerning for safety judges).
- `category`: short label for the detected issue (may be `null`).
- `rationale`: free-form explanation from the judge model.
