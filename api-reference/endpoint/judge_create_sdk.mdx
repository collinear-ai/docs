title: 'Create Judge (SDK Helper)'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/judge/create/sdk'
---

## Overview

Call this helper after uploading a dataset so the Assess run has a specific
judge ID to target. It is intended for SDK and automation scenarios.

Generate a disposable judge configuration for SDK-driven assessments. Call this
after uploading a dataset so the evaluation run can target a specific Collinear
safety rubric.

### Request body

- `judge_name`: Unique name for the judge run (use a timestamp to avoid
  collisions).
- `model_name`: Judge backing model. For safety scoring use `collinear_guard`.
- `space_id`: UUID for the space that owns this judge.

### Example request

```bash
curl https://stage.collinear.ai/api/v1/judge/create/sdk \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "judge_name": "assess-judge-<TIMESTAMP>",
    "model_name": "collinear_guard",
    "space_id": "<SPACE_ID>"
  }'
```

### Response

The API returns a minimal JSON document:

```json
{"id": "<JUDGE_ID>"}
```

Capture the `id` and pass it to the assess run endpoint. Judges created through
this helper are ephemeral and scoped to the target space.
