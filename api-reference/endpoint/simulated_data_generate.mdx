title: 'Generate Simulated Data (JSON)'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/synth_data/generate'
---

## Alert

This method of generating simulated data is different from the SDK. If you wish to create trait-based simulations, use the [SDK](/get-started/quickstart)

## Overview

Generate synthetic conversation rows inline by providing example prompts and a
few seed examples. The service uses the specified model to fan out new samples
that you can immediately download or store. This JSON variant is convenient when
building tooling that programmatically defines the schema and instructions.

### Request body fields

- `model_id`: UUID of the model that should author the synthetic responses.
- `multiplier`: Integer multiplier applied to the number of examples. If you
  send three examples and set `multiplier` to `4`, the service targets twelve
  generations.
- `examples`: Array of objects. Each example can include any keys your pipeline
  understands (commonly `conv_prefix`, `response`, `context`, etc.).
- `prompt`: Instruction prompt that explains how the model should transform the
  examples when creating new rows.

### Example request

```bash
curl https://stage.collinear.ai/api/v1/synth_data/generate \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model_id": "<MODEL_ID>",
    "multiplier": 5,
    "prompt": "Generate safe customer service conversations for billing issues.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "conv_prefix": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "My shipment is missing."}
        ],
        "response": {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "I'm sorry to hear that. Let me check the tracking number."
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Response shape

The API returns an array. Each element includes the original example that the
model expanded from and a `generated` string with the newly created row:

```json
[
  {
    "original": {"conv_prefix": [...], "response": {...}},
    "generated": "{\n  \"conv_prefix\": [...],\n  \"response\": {...}\n}"
  }
]
```

Parse the `generated` string into JSON before storing it. The service may
stream partial chunks before the final array is delivered; buffer the body
before parsing if your HTTP client emits incremental events.
