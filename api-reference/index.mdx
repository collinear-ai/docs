# API Reference

Use the sidebar to explore the Collinear platform API. Start with the [Platform API overview](./introduction) for authentication details, then jump to the endpoint docs:

- [Upload Dataset](./endpoint/upload_dataset)
- [Judge Conversation API](./endpoint/judge_conversation)

Need SDK usage instead? See the dedicated [SDK reference](./sdk/overview).
