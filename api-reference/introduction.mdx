## Authentication

Every request requires a platform API key. Send it in the `Authorization: Bearer <COLLINEAR_API_KEY>` header. You can find all IDs inside the dashboard by following [Platform access](../get-started/platform-access).

## Request format

- Base URL: `https://api.collinear.ai`
- Content type: JSON unless the specific endpoint documents file uploads
- All IDs (`space_id`, `judge_id`, `model_id`, `evaluation_id`) are UUID strings
