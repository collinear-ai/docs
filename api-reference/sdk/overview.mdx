title: Python SDK Overview
description: Understand what the standalone Collinear Python SDK provides and how it differs from the dashboard API.
---

> This section covers the standalone **Collinear Python SDK** that runs locally in scripts or notebooks. For documentation on the dashboard backend and REST API used by the Collinear product, see the API Reference pages.

## When to Use the SDK

Use the SDK when you want to:

- Script Trait Basis simulations directly against an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint.
- Generate synthetic conversations for evaluation, RL fine-tuning, or data analysis without touching the hosted platform.
- Run local guardrail assessments with your own judge model credentials.

Reach for the dashboard API when you need to orchestrate runs inside Collinear's hosted platform or manage Spaces, Judges, and datasets via the product backend.

## Installation

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv add collinear
uv sync
```

or

```bash
pip install --upgrade collinear
```

Set the required credentials before running examples:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export TRAIT_BASIS_API_KEY=tb-...
```

Optional environment variables let you point at a custom assistant base URL (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) or model name (`OPENAI_ASSISTANT_MODEL`).

```python
import os
from collinear.client import Client

client = Client(
    assistant_model_url=os.getenv("OPENAI_BASE_URL", "https://api.openai.com/v1"),
    assistant_model_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    assistant_model_name=os.getenv("OPENAI_ASSISTANT_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini"),
    steer_api_key=TRAIT_BASIS_API_KEY,
)

trait_basis = {
    "ages": ["25-34", "35-44", "45-54"],
    "genders": ["male", "female", "other"],
    "occupations": ["Employed", "Unemployed", "Student"],
    "intents": [
        "modify_booking",
        "cancel_booking_request_refund",
        "check_flight_status",
    ],
    "traits": {
        "impatience": [0, 1, 2],
        "confusion": [0, 1, 2],
    },
    "locations": ["USA", "Canada"],
    "languages": ["English", "Spanish"],
    "tasks": ["airline support"],
}

simulations = client.simulate(trait_basis, k=1, num_exchanges=2)
for turn in simulations[0].conv_prefix:
    print(f"{turn['role']}: {turn['content']}")
print("assistant:", simulations[0].response)
```

The SDK enforces canonical persona buckets: stick to the predefined age ranges and occupation categories; if a combo tries to pair `"Retired"` with an age bucket below `"35-44"`, it is skipped automatically.

The remaining SDK pages dive deeper into configuring simulations, running assessments, adapting notebooks, and stitching together advanced recipes.
