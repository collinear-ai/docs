## What is a Safety Evaluation?

A **Safety Evaluation** measures how well your model adheres to safety guidelines when generating responses. Collinear AI uses a selected **safety judge** to assess risks like harmful, biased, or inappropriate content.

This helps you:

- Detect and categorize unsafe outputs
- Benchmark model behavior against safety standards
- Ensure alignment with responsible AI practices

## Interactive Walkthrough

Want to see it in action? Follow this guided demo to create your safety run:

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"calc(51.66666666666667% + 41px)",height:0,width:"100%" }}>

## Judge Types

Choose the appropriate safety judge based on your evaluation needs:

### 1. **CollinearGuard (Rating)**

Collinear AI’s proprietary Likert-based model using a 1–5 rating scale.

- Use a 5-row scoring table to define your evaluation criteria.
- Each row corresponds to a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

### 2. **CollinearGuard Nano**

Binary classification model that evaluates specific safety dimensions.

- **Evaluation Targets:**
- **Prompt**: Evaluates the user’s input
- **Response**: Evaluates the model’s output
- **Refusal**: Evaluates if the model should or did refuse to respond

### 3. **CollinearGuard Nano (Categories)**

Enhanced version of Nano that also outputs **safety categories** alongside binary results.

- Ideal for more detailed classification use cases.

### 4. **Llama Guard 3**

Meta's off-the-shelf safety model.

- Plug-and-play judge with no customization needed.
- Great for quick or comparative benchmarks.

### 5. **Prompted Model**

Use any model with a custom prompt template.

- Integrate your own model
