## How to Leverage a Collinear Flex Run with Annotations

Follow these steps to create a new run using Collinear Flex using annotated ground truth in an existing run:

1. **Open an Existing Run**
   Start by opening **any Assess run** previously created.
2. **Annotate the Data**
   Use the **Revise Score** feature to provide annotated ground truth on at least 5 rows. The more rows annotated, the better the Judge will align to your criteria.
3. **Create a New Dataset for the New Judge**
   Export the rows with ground truth and combine with your data to be evaluated.
4. **Start a New Assessment**
   Start a new performance assessment, upload the revised dataset with ground truth, and select **Collinear Flex** as the Judge.
5. **Customize the Scoring Criteria**
   A new set of scoring criteria will be generated automatically. You can tweak or regenerate these as needed.
6. **Finalize the Judge**
   Click **Create Assessment** again to finalize and create the run.
