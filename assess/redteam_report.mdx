# Redteam Reports Overview

Redteam Reports provide detailed evaluations and assessments of LLM model behavior under adversarial or edge-case conditions. These evaluations are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, biases, and unexpected outcomes in models before they are deployed in real-world applications.

By leveraging the **Collinear AI Platform**, you can explore these reports, generate custom evaluations, and gain insights into how models perform under various red-teaming strategies.
