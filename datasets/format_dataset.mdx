To assess or improve your models, your dataset needs to follow a specific structure. We support two input formats: **JSON** and **CSV**, with field requirements varying by run type. 

---

## Supported Formats

### 1. JSON Format

Each entry should be a dictionary with the following keys:

- `conv_prefix` — A list of message objects (with `role` and `content`) representing the conversation history. The last turn should be from the user. Required for all run types.
- `response` — A dictionary with the assistant's reply to the last user's input message. Required for all run types.
- `ground_truth` — Integer rating (e.g., 1–5) for the response quality. Required for Performance runs.
- `context` — A string providing additional context. Required for Reliability runs.

Here is a sample JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "conv_prefix": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "response": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there!"},
    "ground_truth": 4,
    "context": "Greeting conversation"
  },
  {
    "conv_prefix": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
    "response": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why did the chicken join a band? Because it had the drumsticks!"}
  }
]
```

### 2. CSV Format

Each row represents one example and should contain:

| Column         | Type                                            | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `conv_prefix`  | `string`                                        | Raw string representing user message.             |
| `response`     | `string`                                        | Assistant's reply (plain text).                   |
| `ground_truth` | `int` _(required for Performance runs only)_    | Integer rating (1–5) of how good the response is. |
| `context`      | `string` _(required for Reliability runs only)_ | Extra context string that may assist evaluation.  |

**Note** :

- _conv_prefix should be a plain string version of the user message._
- The CSV format is flattened — it does not store role metadata. It assumes all conv_prefix entries are from the user role.
