title: Creating Your Organization
---

The Organization  provides an overview and centralized control for managing your AI models,
training data, and organization settings within Collinear AI. Once you create your organization,
you'll have access to key tools and resources that will help you tailor large language models (LLMs) to your enterprise needs.

From this dashboard, you can:

* Manage team members and define roles for accessing different tools.
* Create and manage your spaces, which serve as containers for your AI models and training data.
* View your API Key and access the API documentation.

To get started, create an organization by going to the <a href='https://app.collinear.ai/api/auth/login' >signup page</a>.
