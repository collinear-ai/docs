Spaces in Collinear AI provide a focused environment for developing,
testing, and managing your AI models and datasets.
Once you create a space, you'll have access to a suite of tools that help you customize and refine models,
manage data, and evaluate performance tailored to your organizationâ€™s specific needs.

From the Space dashboard, you can:

* Manage and evaluate your Conversation models.
* Create and iterate over Judges to enhance model performance.
* Create and manage conversations for testing conversational AI models.
* Generate synthetic data to enrich your training datasets.
* Upload, create, and organize datasets.
* Test and evaluate conversation models within real-time scenarios.
* Test and evaluate Judge models, iterating on them for improved accuracy.
* View performance metrics on the Judge leaderboard.
* Annotate data to improve model training and validation.
