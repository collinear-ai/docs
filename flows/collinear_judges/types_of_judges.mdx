# Model Roles and Responsibilities

This guide provides a detailed overview of our different AI judges, categorized by their roles in  safety, reliability, and performance runs. Each judge is designed to ensure that your AI systems operate safely, reliably, and optimally in diverse environments.

### Key Features:

- **Preventative Control**: Detects and prevents potential issues pre-production
- **Detective Control**: Identifies and flags errors post-occurrence
- **Monitoring**: Offers general oversight and diagnostics of system performance
