1. Lynx 8B - Patronus AI's proprietary off the shelf model for detecting hallucinations 

2. Veritas Nano - Collinear AI's proprietary model low latency binary model for hallucination detection

3. Veritas - Collinear AI's proprietary larger model for advanced hallucination detection

4. Prompted Model - Use any off the shelf model with a custom prompt

## Select a Context Engine 
Select from one of 2 options

1. Use Context From Dataset: Users can choose to use context from the dataset

2. Add Context Engine: Users can choose to add context from a RAG engine 

Add details for:
- Content Engine API Key: A unique key required to authenticate and interact securely with a content engine's API.
- RAG Host: The server environment that supports the Retrieve-and-Generate model, facilitating document retrieval and response generation.
- Index: An optimized data structure designed for rapid retrieval of database records.
- Namespace: A context that groups identifiers, functions, or variables to prevent naming conflicts across different scopes.
- Top K: Represents the top 'K' results or outputs selected from a set, based on defined criteria.
