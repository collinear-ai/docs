# Introduction

Custom Judges help evaluate responses based on specific criteria or use cases. They are tailored to unique evaluation requirements, industry standards, or user-defined metrics. Custom Judges are versatile and can be designed to assess responses in various contexts, such as competitions, assessments, or automated content moderation.

They ensure that response are:
- aligned with specific evaluation criteria
- adhere to specific standard
- meet user-defined metrics


You would have to initially [provide some human annotations](/flows/give_human_annotations) to train the custom judge.
The custom judge will then be created based on the annotations provided.

# Steps to Create a Custom Judge
