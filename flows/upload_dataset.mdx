### Parameters

The input dataset in the form of a pandas DataFrame. Each row in the DataFrame should contain:
* conv_prefix: A list of strings representing the conversation prefix.
* response: A dictionary containing the conversation response with a key 'content'.
* ground_truth: Ground truth values for the corresponding conversation.

### API Request Details
The function makes a POST request to the API endpoint to upload the dataset. Here are the key parts of the request:

#### URL:
The URL is formed by concatenating the host and the /api/v1/dataset path.

#### Headers:
The request includes an Authorization header with a Bearer token for authentication(This token can be obtained from the API Key section of the Collinear AI dashboard):
```
{
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
}
```
#### Request Body:
The body of the request is a JSON object with the following fields:

* name: Name of the dataset being uploaded (e.g., 'benchmark-db').
* space_id: Identifier for the space to which the dataset belongs.
* conversations: An array of conversation objects, each containing:
    * conv_prefix: A list of conversation prefixes.
        * role: The role of the message['user','assistant']
        * content: The content of the message.
    * response: The content of the response.
    * judgements: An empty dictionary to store future judgements.
    * ground_truth: The ground truth value for the conversation.

#### Sample Request:
```json
{
  "name": "benchmark-db",
  "space_id": "<space_id>",
  "conversations": [
    {
      "conv_prefix": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need help"}],
      "response": "I need assistance with my account.",
      "judgements": {},
      "ground_truth": "account-related"
    }
  ]
}
```

    }
    conversations = []
    df = pd.DataFrame(df)
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        conversations.append({
            'conv_prefix': list(row['conv_prefix']),
            'response': row['response']['content'],
            'judgements': {},
            'ground_truth': row['ground_truth'],
        })
    req_obj['conversations'] = conversations
    url = f'{host}/api/v1/dataset'
    output = requests.post(url, json=req_obj,
                           headers={
                               'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'})
    response = output.json()
