Spaces in **Collinear AI** provide a focused, collaborative environment for developing, testing, and managing your LLM models and datasets.

Once you create a Space, you’ll gain access to a powerful suite of tools that help you **customize models**, **manage data**, and **evaluate performance** — all tailored to your organization’s specific needs.

## 🚀 What You Can Do in a Space

From your Space dashboard, you can:

- 🧠 **Manage and evaluate conversation models** to ensure optimal interactions.
- 🧪 **Create and iterate on Judges** to enhance model evaluation and performance.
- 💬 **Design and manage conversations** for testing your conversational AI workflows.
- 📈 **Generate synthetic data** to enrich and diversify your training datasets.
- 📂 **Upload, create, and organize datasets** to streamline your AI pipeline.
- 🧵 **Test and evaluate conversation models** in real-time, contextual scenarios.
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Test and improve Judge models**, iterating for increased accuracy and robustness.
- 📝 **Annotate data** to strengthen model training and validation.

## 🏷️ Naming Your Space

Choose a **descriptive name** for your Space. This name will be used:

- To identify your Space in the dashboard

Pick something meaningful and relevant to your project or team.
