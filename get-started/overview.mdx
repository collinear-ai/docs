# Get Started with Collinear

Collinear's data flywheel transforms how you develop and improve AI systems through three core capabilities: **Simulate**, **Analyze**, and **Curate**. This guide will help you understand how these components work together to create a continuous improvement loop.

## The Data Flywheel Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Simulate">
    Generate realistic user interactions with diverse personas and edge cases to stress-test your AI agents. This is where you discover real-world failure modes that manual testing would miss.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Use AI Judges to systematically evaluate performance across 20+ metrics for safety, reliability, and performance. Pinpoint specific failure modes and areas for improvement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Curate">
    Generate high-signal semi-synthetic data tailored to identified gaps, creating targeted training data for post-training improvement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why the Data Flywheel Works

### 🎯 **Discover Real-World Failure Modes**
Traditional testing relies on manual test cases and known scenarios. Collinear's simulations generate thousands of diverse user interactions, exposing edge cases and failure modes that would otherwise go unnoticed.

### ⚡ **Scale QA Beyond Human Capacity**
Replace manual testing with automated, reproducible simulations that cover thousands of scenarios in minutes, not months.

### 🔄 **Close the Feedback Loop**
Generate targeted training data based on actual performance gaps, not guesswork. Every improvement is data-driven and measurable.

### 🚀 **Accelerate Development Cycles**
Move from evaluation to improvement in days, not months, with continuous insights and automated data generation.

## Core Capabilities Deep Dive

### Simulate: Realistic User Interactions

The simulation engine generates high-fidelity, multi-turn conversations with diverse user personas. Each simulation includes:

- **Demographic diversity**: Ages, genders, occupations, locations, language
- **Personality traits**: Impatience, confusion, skepticism, urgency, incoherence
- **Intent variety**: Search, booking, complaints, technical issues, escalations
- **Edge cases**: Unusual scenarios, high-stress situations, complex requests

### Analyze: Comprehensive Evaluation

Our AI Judges evaluate your systems across 20+ metrics, providing detailed insights into:

- **Safety**: Harmful content, bias, inappropriate responses
- **Reliability**: Consistency, accuracy, factual correctness
- **Performance**: Response quality, helpfulness, user satisfaction, intent understanding, role adherence, looping behavior
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific criteria tailored to your use case

### Curate: Targeted Data Generation

Transform insights from analysis into high-quality training data:

- **Gap-focused generation**: Create data specifically targeting identified weaknesses
- **Quality filtering**: Use AI Judges to ensure only high-signal examples are included
- **Format flexibility**: Generate data in formats compatible with your training pipeline
- **Continuous improvement**: Iteratively refine data based on model performance

## Integration Options

### API-First Approach
Access all capabilities through our REST API for maximum flexibility:

```bash
# Generate simulations
curl -X POST https://api.collinear.ai/simulate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"personas": [...], "scenarios": [...]}'

# Analyze results
curl -X POST https://api.collinear.ai/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"conversations": [...], "judges": [...]}'
```

### Platform UI
Use our web interface for visual workflows and team collaboration:

- Drag-and-drop persona configuration
- Real-time evaluation dashboards
- Collaborative result review
- Export-ready data formatting

### SDK Integration
Use our Python SDK for programmatic access:

```python
from collinear import Client

client = Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Generate simulations
simulations = client.simulate(personas=personas, scenarios=scenarios)

# Analyze with judges
results = client.analyze(conversations=simulations, judges=judges)

# Curate training data
training_data = client.curate(insights=results, target_gaps=gaps)
```
