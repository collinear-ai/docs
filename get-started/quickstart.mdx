title: Quickstart
description: Run your first Trait Basis simulation and assessment in minutes.
---

## 1. Create an environment with uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --upgrade pip collinear
```

## 2. Create a short script `quickstart.py`

```python
from collinear.client import Client

client = Client(
    assistant_model_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    assistant_model_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    assistant_model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    steer_api_key=TRAIT_BASIS_API_KEY,
)

trait_basis = {
    "ages": [27, 46],
    "genders": ["woman", "man"],
    "occupations": ["support_manager", "field_technician", "network_engineer"],
    "intents": ["billing_dispute", "service_cancellation", "device_troubleshooting"],
    "traits": {
        "confusion": [-1],
        "impatience": [0, 2],
    },
    "locations": ["united_states", "canada"],
    "languages": ["en", "es"],
    "tasks": ["Airline", "Ski Resort"],
}

conversations = client.simulate(trait_basis, k=3, num_exchanges=3)
assessment = client.assess(conversations)
print(assessment)
```

Replace the placeholder keys with your own before running.

## 3. Execute the run

```bash
uv run python quickstart.py
```

The script leaves you with two Python objects:

- `conversations`: the generated Trait Basis conversations.
- `assessment`: safety scores for each conversation.

Inspect them in your editor or an interactive shell, then move on to the [Trait Basis simulation guide](simulations) for deeper configuration or the [Platform API](/api-reference/endpoint/judge_conversation) when you need hosted runs.
