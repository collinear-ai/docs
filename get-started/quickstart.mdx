# Quickstart Guide

Get started with Collinear's data flywheel in just 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through running your first simulation, analyzing the results, and generating training data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A Collinear API key ([get one here](https://collinear.ai))
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic familiarity with command line tools

## Step 1: Install the Collinear SDK

Install the Collinear Python SDK:

```bash
pip install collinear
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your API Key

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export COLLINEAR_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or create a `.env` file:

```bash
echo "COLLINEAR_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Simulation

Create a new Python file `quickstart.py`:

```python
from collinear import Client

# Initialize the client
client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here")

# Define a simple persona configuration
personas = {
    "frustrated_customer": {
        "traits": {
            "impatience": [-1,0, 2],
            "skeptical": [-2, 1, 2],
            "incoherence": [1, 2]
        },
        "intents": ["complaint", "escalation", "refund_request"],
        "demographics": {
            "ages": [25, 35, 45],
            "genders": ["male", "female"],
            "occupations": ["employed", "business_owner"]
        }
    }
}

# Generate simulations
print("Generating simulations...")
simulations = client.simulate(
    personas=personas,
    num_scenarios=5,
    exchanges_per_scenario=3
)

print(f"Generated {len(simulations)} simulations")
```

Run the simulation:

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

## Step 4: Analyze the Results

Add analysis to your script:

```python
# Analyze the simulations
print("Analyzing simulations...")
analysis = client.analyze(
    conversations=simulations,
    judges=["safety", "helpfulness", "empathy"]
)

print(f"Analysis complete!")
print(f"Average safety score: {analysis.average_safety_score:.2f}")
print(f"Average helpfulness score: {analysis.average_helpfulness_score:.2f}")
```

## Step 5: Generate Training Data

Create targeted training data based on the analysis:

```python
# Generate training data
print("Generating training data...")
training_data = client.curate(
    insights=analysis,
    target_improvements=["safety", "empathy"],
    num_examples=100
)

print(f"Generated {len(training_data)} training examples")
```

## Complete Example

Here's the complete `quickstart.py` script:

```python
from collinear import Client

def main():
    # Initialize the client
    client = Client(api_key="your-api-key-here")
    
    # Define personas
    personas = {
        "frustrated_customer": {
            "traits": {
                "impatience": [1, 2],
                "skeptical": [1, 2],
                "urgency": [1, 2]
            },
            "intents": ["complaint", "escalation", "refund_request"],
            "demographics": {
                "ages": [25, 35, 45],
                "genders": ["male", "female"],
                "occupations": ["employed", "business_owner"]
            }
        },
        "confused_user": {
            "traits": {
                "confusion": [1, 2],
                "impatience": [0, 1],
                "politeness": [1, 2]
            },
            "intents": ["technical_issue", "billing_question", "general_inquiry"],
            "demographics": {
                "ages": [55, 65, 75],
                "genders": ["male", "female"],
                "occupations": ["retired", "unemployed"]
            }
        }
    }
    
    # Step 1: Generate simulations
    print("🎭 Generating simulations...")
    simulations = client.simulate(
        personas=personas,
        num_scenarios=10,
        exchanges_per_scenario=3
    )
    print(f"✅ Generated {len(simulations)} simulations")
    
    # Step 2: Analyze results
    print("🔍 Analyzing simulations...")
    analysis = client.analyze(
        conversations=simulations,
        judges=["safety", "accuracy", "empathy", "role_adherence", "intent_understanding"]
    )
    print(f"✅ Analysis complete!")
    print(f"   Average safety score: {analysis.average_safety_score:.2f}")
    print(f"   Average helpfulness score: {analysis.average_helpfulness_score:.2f}")
    print(f"   Average empathy score: {analysis.average_empathy_score:.2f}")
    print(f"   Average role adherence score: {analysis.average_role_adherence_score:.2f}")
    print(f"   Average intent understanding score: {analysis.average_intent_understanding_score:.2f}")
    
    # Step 3: Generate training data
    print("📚 Generating training data...")
    training_data = client.curate(
        insights=analysis,
        target_improvements=["safety", "empathy"],
        num_examples=50
    )
    print(f"✅ Generated {len(training_data)} training examples")
    
    # Step 4: Save results
    print("💾 Saving results...")
    client.save_results(
        simulations=simulations,
        analysis=analysis,
        training_data=training_data,
        output_dir="./quickstart_results"
    )
    print("✅ Results saved to ./quickstart_results/")
    
    print("\n🎉 Quickstart complete! You've successfully:")
    print("   1. Generated diverse user simulations")
    print("   2. Analyzed performance across multiple metrics")
    print("   3. Created targeted training data")
    print("   4. Saved everything for further use")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Understanding the Results

### Simulations
Each simulation contains:
- **Conversation**: Multi-turn dialogue between user and AI
- **Persona**: User characteristics (age, traits, intent)
- **Task**: Task or goal that the user is intending to achieve

### Analysis
The analysis provides scores across multiple dimensions:
- **Safety**: Harmful content, bias, inappropriate responses
- **Accuracy**: Task completion accuracy
- **Empathy**: Emotional understanding and appropriate responses
- **Role Adherence**: Adherence to assistant role
- **Intent Understanding**: Understanding user intent for a task

### Training Data
Generated examples include:
- **Input**: User messages and context
- **Output**: Improved AI responses
- **Metadata**: Persona details and improvement rationale

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed the quickstart:

1. **Explore the results** in the `./quickstart_results/` directory
2. **Customize personas** for your specific use case
3. **Add custom judges** for domain-specific evaluation
4. **Scale up** to larger datasets and more complex scenarios
