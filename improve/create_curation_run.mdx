## What is Synthetic Improvement?

**Synthetic improvement** is the process of automatically generating diverse, high-quality examples to power model training, evaluation, or fine-tuning. With Collinear AI, you can amplify your dataset while maintaining control over quality, diversity, and relevance.

Key features:

- **Scale fast**: Generate hundreds to thousands of samples with minimal effort.
- **Maintain precision**: Define exactly what quality looks like for your use case.
- **Stay flexible**: Customize generation settings and quality filters.

---

## Amplification Factor

The **Amplification Factor** determines how much you expand your data:

- **Higher amplification** → More synthetic samples per input.
- **Lower amplification** → Fewer, more targeted samples.

This setting allows you to balance **quantity** and **improvement precision** based on your project's needs.

## Supported Generator Models

Collinear AI supports the most powerful and versatile models for synthetic data generation:

- **GPT-4o** — OpenAI’s flagship model, excelling at reasoning, creativity, and instruction-following.
- **LLaMA 70B** — Optimized for balanced performance and efficiency.
- **LLaMA 405B** — Massive-scale model offering unparalleled depth and nuance.
- **Qwen 72B** — Strong multilingual and instruction-following capabilities, ideal for diverse domains.

Select the model that best matches your **data complexity**, **domain**, and **scale** requirements.

## Improvement Quality Criteria

To ensure every piece of generated data meets high standards, Collinear AI allows you to filter outputs based on these key dimensions:

- **Correctness**: How accurately outputs match desired criteria and ground truth examples.
- **Naturalness**: How well outputs mimic real-world language patterns and tone.
- **Diversity**: The range and uniqueness of generated variations, ensuring broad coverage.
- **Coherence**: Logical and semantic flow throughout the output.
- **Instruction Following**: Adherence to the specified prompts and task instructions.
- **Quality of Reasoning**: Depth, logic, and coherence in the explanations and conclusions.

You can apply one or multiple improvement filters to align the dataset with your specific needs.

## Best Practices for Successful Improvement Runs

- **Mix Quality Filters**: Combine multiple improvement criteria for a balanced dataset.
- **Tune Amplification**: Start small and adjust amplification as you analyze generation patterns.
- **Spot-Check Outputs**: Always manually review a subset of samples to validate automatic improvement.

Following these steps ensures you achieve **high-quality**, **task-aligned**, and **scalable** synthetic datasets every time.
