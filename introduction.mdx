title: What is Collinear AI?
description: "Collinear is a one-stop post-training platform, purpose-built to help teams evaluate, pressure-test, and align their AI systems for real-world use.

Collinear’s platform and API provide a unified workflow for post-training improvement — combining AI-driven assessment, adversarial testing, and targeted data generation to equip enterprises throughout the AI improvement flywheel. Collinear's core capabilities include:

1. Assess: Leverages AI Judges to evaluate eneterprise AI for Safety, Reliability, and Performance.

2. Red-team: Simulate adversarial prompts and regulatory edge cases to identify tool vulnerabilities and failure modes.

3. Curate: Generate and filter high-signal synthetic data using our proprietary Judges to use for targeted model post-training."

Collinear is designed to fit directly into your post-training workflow — whether you're evaluating models in staging or continuously improving production systems. By combining structured evaluation, automated red-teaming, and high-signal data generation, the platform helps you:

- **Debug model behavior with precision:** Use Judges to pinpoint where outputs break down—across safety, reliability, and custom metrics.

- **Automate testing at scale:** Replace manual QA and prompt hacking with reproducible, adversarial test runs mapped to real-world risks.

- **Generate retrain-ready data:** Curate synthetic examples tailored to known gaps, filtered and scored by policy-aligned models.

- **Integrate flexibly:** Access everything via API or platform UI — whether you're building eval pipelines, tuning loops, or review dashboards.
