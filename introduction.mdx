title: What is Collinear AI?
description: "Collinear powers the AI data flywheel through realistic simulations, QA testing, and intelligent data improvement. Start with high-fidelity, realistic user simulations to identify gaps, then seamlessly bridge to targeted data generation for post-training improvement.

Collinear's platform creates a continuous improvement loop: simulate diverse user interactions to stress-test your AI agents for robustness to real world scenarios, identify failure modes through comprehensive QA, and generate high-signal training data to close those gaps. This data flywheel accelerates AI development from evaluation to production-ready systems.

Collinear's core capabilities for the Data Flywheel process include:

1. Simulate: Generate realistic, multi-turn user interactions with diverse personas and edge cases to stress-test AI agents.

2. Analyze: Glean insights into enteprise AI across 20+ metrics for Performance, Safety, and Reliability using state-of-the-art judges for scoring against your bespoke policies.

3. Improve: Generate and filter high-signal semi-synthetic data using our proprietary Judges for targeted model post-training."

This flywheel approach helps you:

- **Discover real-world failure modes:** Simulate diverse user interactions to find edge cases that manual testing would miss.

- **Scale QA beyond human capacity:** Replace manual testing with automated, reproducible simulations that cover thousands of scenarios.

- **Close the feedback loop:** Generate targeted training data based on actual performance gaps, not guesswork.

- **Accelerate development cycles:** Move from evaluation to improvement in days, not months, with data-driven insights.
