title: Collinear AI Overview
description: Learn the two Collinear surfaces and where to start.
---

Collinear accelerates agent evaluation and improvement through two complementary surfaces:

- **Collinear Platform API** – REST endpoints for running hosted simulations, judges, and data exports. Call it today with cURL and soon through the SDK.
- **Collinear Trait Basis SDK** – [A Python package](https://pypi.org/project/collinear/) that uses our Trait Basis API to generate high-fidelity conversations.

Use Collinear to:

- Generate millions of realistic, multi-turn conversations bound to policies and intents.
- Score those outputs against production-grade evaluations.
- Ship targeted fixes faster by promoting only the highest-signal data into training.

### Choose your next step

- Get set up to view assessments in the [Collinear Dashboard](get-started/platform-access).
- Run the [Quickstart](get-started/quickstart) to run a Trait Basis simulation and analyze it in seconds.
- Review the [Trait Basis simulation guide](get-started/simulations) when you are ready to generate millions of high quality synthetic samples.
- Call the [Platform API endpoints](api-reference/endpoint/judge_conversation) directly when you need hosted runs that appear in your dashboard space.
