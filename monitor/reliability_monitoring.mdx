## 📊 Key Metrics Overview

Monitor the most important indicators of AI reliability:

1. **Total Volume** – The number of queries processed.
2. **Reliability Index** – A measure of how consistently your AI performs without failures or inaccuracies.
3. **Factual Error Rate** – The percentage of responses that were factually incorrect.
4. **Contextual Error Rate** – The frequency at which responses are incorrect due to misinterpretation of context.

## 📈 Critical Summaries

Understand trends over time with visual insights:

- **Total Queries vs. Flagged Queries**
View a time-series graph that compares the number of total queries with the number of flagged ones.

- **Flagged Categories**
Categorization of flagged queries to identify common reliability issues.

## 🧠 Hallucination Categories

Identify and classify the types of hallucinations detected in AI responses:

- **Logical** – Incorrect reasoning or fallacies.
- **Temporal** – Misstatements about time, dates, or sequencing.
- **Entity** – Inaccuracies about named entities (people, places, organizations).
- **Contextual** – Misunderstandings within conversational context.
- **Other** – Unclassified or ambiguous errors.
