# Key Metrics Overview

1. **Total Volume**: The total number of queries processed by your AI system.
2. **Reliability Index**: A measure of how consistently your AI solution performs accurately and without failure over time.
3. **Response Safety Violation Rate**: The percentage of instances where your AI solution provides incorrect or misleading information.
4. **Contextual Error Rate**: The frequency at which your AI provides incorrect responses based on the context of a conversation.

## Threshold Color Indicators
