title: Quickstart
description: Run your first Trait Basis simulation and assessment in minutes.
---

## 1. Create an environment with uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --upgrade pip collinear
```

## 2. Create a short script `quickstart.py`

```python
from collinear.client import Client

client = Client(
    assistant_model_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    assistant_model_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    assistant_model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    steer_api_key=TRAIT_BASIS_API_KEY,
)

trait_basis = {
    "ages": ["13-17", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"],
    "genders": ["male", "female", "other"],
    "occupations": ["Unemployed", "Employed", "Student", "Retired", "Not in Labor Force"],
    "intents": [
        "search_flights",
        "make_booking",
        "modify_booking",
        "cancel_booking_request_refund",
        "track_baggage",
    ],
    "traits": {
        "impatience": [0, 1, 2],
        "confusion": [0, 1, 2],
        "skeptical": [0, 1, 2],
    },
    "locations": ["USA", "Canada", "UK", "Australia", "other"],
    "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "French", "other"],
    "tasks": ["airline support"],
}

conversations = client.simulate(trait_basis, k=3, num_exchanges=3)
assessment = client.assess(conversations)
print(assessment)
```

The SDK validates these persona buckets. Supplying unsupported ages or occupations raises immediately, while combinations that pair `"Retired"` with an age bucket below `"35-44"` are skipped.

Replace the placeholder keys with your own before running.

## 3. Execute the run

```bash
uv run python quickstart.py
```

The script leaves you with two Python objects:

- `conversations`: the simulated Trait Basis conversations.
- `assessment`: safety scores for each conversation.

Inspect them in your editor or an interactive shell, then move on to the [Trait Basis simulation guide](simulations) for deeper configuration or the [Platform API](/api-reference/endpoint/judge_conversation) when you need hosted runs.
